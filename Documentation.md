## Introduction
This documentation outlines secure coding practices and improvements made to address security concerns in the provided code. The code has been reviewed and updated to enhance security.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these instructions to set up and run the improved code:

1. Clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-directory
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables for sensitive information:
   - Set `EMAIL_USER` to your email address.
   - Set `EMAIL_PASSWORD` to your email password.

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Analysis Findings
The analysis of the provided code revealed the following issues:
- Use of an insecure email service (Gmail).
- Storage of sensitive email information in the code.

## Recommendations
To address the identified issues, the following recommendations have been implemented:
- Use a secure email service (replace 'Gmail' with a secure service).
- Store sensitive email information in environment variables (`process.env.EMAIL_USER` and `process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD`).
- Use HTTPS for serving web pages to enhance security.

## Code Snippets

### Code Issue: Use of Insecure Email Service
```javascript
// Original Code
service: 'Gmail',
```

### Code Fix: Use a Secure Email Service
```javascript
// Updated Code
service: 'YourSecureEmailService', // Replace with a secure email service
```

### Code Issue: Storage of Sensitive Information
```javascript
// Original Code
auth: {
  user: 'chauhanamit76342@gmail.com', // Your email address
  pass: 'Amit_s64' // Your email password (use environment variables for better security)
}
```

### Code Fix: Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Information
```javascript
// Updated Code
auth: {
  user: process.env.EMAIL_USER, // Use environment variables
  pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD // Use environment variables
}
```

### Code Issue: Lack of HTTPS
```javascript
// Original Code
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'form.html'));
});
```

### Code Fix: Serve Web Pages over HTTPS
```javascript
// Updated Code
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'form.html'));
});
```
