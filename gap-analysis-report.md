# Gap Analysis Report: Bug Fixes in Script

Date: 24/10/2023

Report Prepared By: Amit Singh

# Current State (Baseline): 

The original script contains multiple issues and bugs that impact security, maintainability, and code quality.
Desired State (Future Goals):

The desired state is to have a clean, secure, and well-structured script that adheres to best practices.
Gap Analysis:

# Security Gap:

* Current State: The original script stores the email password directly in the code, which is a security risk.
* Desired State: The desired state is to use environment variables to store sensitive information securely.
* Gap: The gap between the current state and desired state is a potential security vulnerability.

# Middleware Order Gap:

* Current State: In the original script, the 'helmet' middleware is placed before defining the route for sending emails.
* Desired State: The desired state is to apply 'helmet.hidePoweredBy()' middleware after defining the email-sending route.
* Gap: The gap between the current state and desired state is an issue related to middleware order.

# Bug Fixes:

1. Security Bug Fix:

* Description: The hardcoded email password in the original script has been replaced with environment variables.
* Implementation: The email user and password are now loaded from environment variables.
* Result: Sensitive information is now stored securely.

2. Middleware Order Fix:

* Description: In the original script, the 'helmet' middleware was placed before defining the route for sending emails. In the fixed script, the 'helmet.hidePoweredBy()' middleware is applied after defining the email-sending route.
* Implementation: The 'helmet.hidePoweredBy()' middleware is now applied in the correct order.
* Result: Middleware order has been corrected.


In order to enhance the security of our application, we have implemented several secure coding practices following industry standards and best practices. These practices are designed to mitigate the risk of cryptographic failures, sensitive data exposure, and insecure communication. Here are some of the key secure coding practices that have been implemented:

# Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Shell (SSH):

* The application ensures that data transmits over secure, authenticated, and encrypted protocols, such as TLS or SSH.
* Clear-text protocols like telnet have been replaced with SSH.
* Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), Secure Copy (SCP), or FTPS are used instead of FTP.
* HTTPS is enforced for secure web communication.
* SMTP over SSL/TLS or SMTP with STARTTLS is used instead of clear-text SMTP.

# Encryption of Cloud Component Communications:

* Communication between cloud components is encrypted whenever possible to prevent unauthorized access.

# Blocking Mixed Content:

* The application is configured to block mixed content when rendering web pages to prevent security vulnerabilities.

# OS-Level Deactivation of Clear-Text Traffic:

* Where available, clear-text traffic is deactivated at the operating system level to eliminate security risks.

# Secure Transport Channels:

The application secures all transport channels, even within local networks, to prevent vulnerabilities that may compromise the entire application or system.

# The compliant solutions for these practices have been implemented as follows:

URLs are consistently updated to use HTTPS, SFTP, or SSH.
For email sending with Nodemailer, configurations are set to ensure secure communication.
For FTP, secure connections are enforced.
In AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ALB), application listeners are configured to use HTTPS and TLS.
In AWS Elastic Cache, transit encryption is enabled.
AWS Kinesis streams are explicitly encrypted.
The adoption of these secure coding practices not only enhances security but also aligns our application with industry standards, ensuring that sensitive data is handled securely.

# Conclusion:

The gap analysis report identifies two critical issues in the original script and provides a clear description of the bug fixes in the improved script. By addressing these issues, the script has been made more secure, maintainable, and aligned with best practices.
Recommendations:

Continue to follow best practices for security, code quality, and maintainability in all code development.
Consider using additional security and validation measures as per project requirements.
Next Steps:

Regularly review and update the script to ensure it remains secure and follows best practices.
Conduct code reviews to catch and fix issues early in the development process.
